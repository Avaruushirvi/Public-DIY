Youtube was the biggest source of knowledge and also became a place for enthusiasm for excitement,
when others made such wonderful creations, including for electric guitars.
I just ended up with a light, but still all-around burning, because birch is quite hard wood species,
and I didn't get structure I wanted from the test plank.
However, the direction of the wood grain is almost upright, so the soft and hard are very close each of others looking from surface.

So, now I'm more looking for the color difference in "brownish-goldish".
